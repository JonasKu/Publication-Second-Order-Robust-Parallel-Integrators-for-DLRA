# Publication-Second-Order-Robust-Parallel-Integrators-for-DLRA

This repository collects the numerical test cases for the manuscript "Second-order robust parallel integrators for dynamical low-rank approximation". All numerical experiments are computed with Julia, Version 1.10.2. To run all experiments, simply go into one of the directories and type `julia main.jl` into the command line. This will install all required packages, run all computations, and reproduce all figures from the manuscript.
